    * Led multiple projects related to MARL, such as MAC-PO (finding an optimized prioritization scheme in MARL) and AccMER (developing a data-reuse strategy to accelerate MARL).
    * Responsibilities: MARL theoretical problem formulation, experiment
    * _Highlights_: Python, PyTorch, Cython
  * **Topic 2**: Bayesian optimization
    * Develop a novel gradient-aware Bayesian optimization algorithm to locate local optima and a Bayesian optimization model for doubly stochastic point process.
    * Responsibilities: Theoretical derivation, time series analysis, experiment
    * _Highlights_: Python, MATLAB, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas
  * **Topic 3**: Multi-modal medical image processing
    * Develop a multi-modal brain tumor MRI image segmentation model via data fusion and attention with extracted novel common information microstructures among different modalities.
    * Responsibilities: Information theatrical analysis, medical image analysis, model design, experiment
    * _Highlights_: Python, PyTorch, Keras, Transformer
  * **Topic 4**: Network security via protocol customization
    * Develop a reliable application-layer moving target defense model via customized communication protocols and dynamic synchronization and management.
    * Responsibilities: protocol analysis, moving target design, self-synchronization design, experiment
    * _Highlights_: C, Python, Linux kernel
* Summer 2017: Electronic Engineer Student Intern
  * Electrical and Electronic Technology Innovation Center, HUST
