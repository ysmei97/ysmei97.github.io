## Determining sub-optimal solution in an unknown function 

Giving up the optimal solution while turning to a sub-optimal one is painful. However, even if finding all or most global optima is desired in many real-world problems that can be seen as multimodal optimization, implementing the optimal solutions is sometimes infeasible due to various practical restrictions, such as resource limitations, physical constraints, etc.

We developed a multimodal Bayesian optimization (MBO) framework to locate a set of local/global solutions of a given unknown expensive function. We derive the joint distribution of the objective function and its first-order gradients and introduce new acquisition functions backed by this joint distribution to decide local optima sequentially during optimization.
