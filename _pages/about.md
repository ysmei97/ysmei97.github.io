Welcome to my website!
======

My name is Yongsheng Mei, and I am an Applied Scientist at <a href="https://www.amazon.science/author/yongsheng-mei">Amazon</a>. I earned my Ph.D. in 2024 from <a href="https://www.gwu.edu/">The George Washington University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~tlan/">Prof. Tian Lan</a>. My doctoral research focused on Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, and foundation models. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering in 2019 from <a href="https://english.hust.edu.cn/">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a>.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:ysmei97@gmail.com) if you want to collaborate on research projects or other opportunities. Thank you!
