Welcome to my website!

My name is Yongsheng Mei, and I am currently a Ph.D. student at [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) advised by Prof. Tian Lan. My research primarily focuses on reinforcement learning, multi-agent learning, and Bayesian optimization. Before joining GWU, I was an undergraduate student in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering in 2019.
