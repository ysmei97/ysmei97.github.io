Welcome to my website!
======

My name is Yongsheng Mei, and I am currently a Ph.D. student at [the George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) advised by [Prof. Tian Lan](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~tlan/). My research primarily focuses on reinforcement learning, multi-agent learning, multi-modal learning, and Bayesian optimization. Before joining GWU, I was an undergraduate student in [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering in 2019.
