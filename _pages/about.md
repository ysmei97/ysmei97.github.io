Welcome to my website!
======

My name is Yongsheng Mei, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [the George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) advised by [Prof. Tian Lan](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~tlan/). My research primarily focuses on Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, and network security. Before joining GWU, I was an undergraduate student at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/), where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering in 2019.
